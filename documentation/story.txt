Welcome Traveler, to Granfalter, a world of adventure and opportunity.
I am Luna an Emissary of Fortuna, Goddess of this world.
The Goddess has decreed that all visitors are entitled to a small land plot to build on and a modest sum of coin with which to start your fortune.
It is Fortuna's sincere desire that you will use these gifts to create a prosperous new guild to explore the world and serve the people of Granfalter.

First, here are your coins:
+100 coins
You can use them to hire help and build your guild.
You may also offer your coins to Fortuna to receive Her blessing in the form of new gear for your guild members.
There are many Gods besides Fortuna in Granfalter that you can contract with, but more on Them later.

Now about your guild plot...
Strangely, there have been a surprising number of visitors recently, more than we've seen in many years.
Unfortunately, because of this, we've been struggling to keep up with preparing new plots for visitors.
I do have something used available, but its been abandoned for so long that its been picked over by looters
and become a den of monsters...
Since this doesn't live up to our normal contract however, I have made the following arrangement for you:
You can keep anything you recover while renovating the guild hall, and we will hire an adventurer for you
to help with clearing it out and get your guild off to a promising start.
That's not so bad right? And who knows, if Fortune is on your side, maybe there will be some valuable treasures that the looters left behind.

Ah, here is your new guild hero, Primadona, now.
[Primadona walks onto screen (I guess outside of guild entrance)]
Let's send them in to clear out the foyer so your guild heroes will have a place to stay.
You can observe your guild heroes as they take on tasks, but they will act on their own so you don't need to give them any additional instructions.
Let's see how Primadona does with clearing out the guild foyer.
[Primadona advances on the first enemy]
Guild heroes will engage any enemies they come across, only advancing once all enemies have been defeated.
[Primadona defeats the enemy]
Nice work, let's keep going.
[Primadona defeats two more enemies]
Well, they put up a bit of a fight, but overall, that didn't look too tough. Nice work Primadona!

Let's see what we've got here:
* A table with a small map of the world [Add table + map to foyer] [create world map icon] (or just use table?)
* An old pot with 50 coins. Nice! You can keep your savings in here for now [Add pot to foyer] [display coins indicator at top of screen]
* A Shrine to the Goddess Fortuna. You can use this to make offerings to Fortuna for new gear.
* A Bed. Primdona can use this to rest here

Next let's try to clear out the front hall.
[Primadona engages the first enemy, but deals little damage initially]
Uh oh...
[Primadona continues to fight and is losing]
These monsters just a little further in seem much tougher!

It appears that Primadona was defeated, but don't worry! The Goddess has made Granfalter a world of gentle consequences.
A hero that is defeated in battle will always be regenerated in the last safe place they were, so Primadona is waiting for us back in the foyer.
[Back in the foyer]
Even though Primadona is okay, it doesn't look like they will be able to clear out the front hall with their current power.
What you need is the Power of the Gods.
Here, I've marked the locations of several nearby shrines on the map we found in the foyer.
[Open World Map and display and rotate to the first area]
Each shrine was built as a contract with one of the many Gods of Granfalter.
[Display and rotate to the second area]
If a guild hero is able to reach one of these shrines, they will be blessed with Divinity, the divine favor of the Gods.
[Display and rotate to the final area (matched to Primadona's job class)] [Display Divinity indicator next to Primadona icon at top of screen]
When a hero has enough Divinity, they may use it to worship at a shrine and contract with the God of that shrine to become more powerful and learn a new skill.
[Add Primadona's icon to the final area]
Send Primadona out to one of the shrines I have marked so that they can grow powerful enough to clear out the front hall.
[Player is now free to choose an area or close the map and do whatever]

[Once Primadona is level 2]
Primadona is looking a lot stronger now, maybe they can clear out the front hall!
[Highlight the Shrine to Fortuna]
If they are still struggling, try praying at the shrine for new gear to equip them with.
[Highlight the World Map]
If you need more coins, you can send Primadona out on adventures. You can even instruct them to automatically repeat the same area if you like.

[On defeating the first enemy in the Front Hall]
Nice, looking good! (could change dialog based on % health)
Oh, here comes some more.
[On defeating second group]
Excellent!
[Boss appears]
This one looks tough...
[On defeating the boss]

They did it, the front hall is clear, let's see what we've got:
* A cracked Anima Orb. There isn't much Anima left and it doesn't look like it can hold much but you can collect some Anima here to enchant your gear [Display anima drop down +10 Anima]
* Another Bed. With an extra bed, you can hire another hero to join your guild. Speaking of which there is also...
* An application board. Itenerate heroes can post applications here for you to consider.


The world of consequence where defeat can no longer be ignored.
The world of extreme consequence, where defeat is final.




Final boss will be something like a tree demon (evil Yggdrasil?) with roots growing into all the child worlds of Granfalter.
From each root it gains increased stats and unique abilities associated each world, for example:
The ability to infinitely consume restorative and buffing foods.
The ability to summon powerful minions.
The effect of returning the hero to the beginning of a long multistage fight on defeat instead of restarting the most recent stage.
etc.

Completing content in the child worlds of Granfalter will allow the hero to enable inhibitors during the final battle that remove or reduce these abilities.
This creates multiple goals of first defeating the boss at all (probably be disabling more than half of its abilities) and then powering up a character so
much that they can defeat the boss without any of the inhibitors enabled.
