Feature Improvements
-Fewer areas more monsters. Switch monsters to appear in groups and have up to 3 groups per area.
-At some point implement monster group patterns and preset monster groups with leaders. Apply
    enchantments to entire groups, and imbued to only leaders, add aoe buffs to imbued monsters.
-Add AI overrides to monsters. If present run this before actor loop is called. It should set an
    activity or do nothing. Can be set on a monster type, and overidden on a particular monster instance.
-Player's divinity score should be effected by their kill %
-Don't reset character stats on entering areas
    - Dark Knight overheal should lose N% health per second when not aggrod
    - Permanent effects should be removed on entering a guild area or when their source disappears
    - Restore cooldowns on entering a guild area?


Testing

Notes:
Using imagemagick montage to convert animated gif to sprite sheet:
XXX This skewed the image: montage -geometry 30x60+1+1 -background transparent musicAnimation.gif montage.png
This is pretty good, but the first frame was too high for some reason, also there are 2 pixels between each frame...
